# PIV-Gravity-machine-on-oceans
This is a set of codes for analysing the data from the Gravity machine [Krishnamurthy, D., Li, H., Benoit du Rey, F. et al. Scale-free vertical tracking microscopy. Nat Methods 17, 1040â€“1051 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-0924-7] that includes:
1) Sedimentation data with images for particle morphology
 -- 
2) PIV with micron sized beads suspended in the fluid

These codes were used in a recent preprint: R. Chajwa et al. Hidden comet-tails of Marine snow Impede Ocean based Carbon Sequestration.
