# Particle Imaging Velocimetry in Noisy Environments
This is a set of codes for analysing the data from the Gravity machine [Krishnamurthy, D., Li, H., Benoit du Rey, F. et al. Scale-free vertical tracking microscopy. Nat Methods 17, 1040â€“1051 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-0924-7] on a ship. The low frequency noise is eliminated using a two-axis gimbal. For an example dataset see: Chajwa, Rahul et al. (2024). Hidden comet-tails of marine snow impede ocean-based carbon sequestration [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v15dv4253

Raw_Sedimentation_PIV_data directory contains various folders with folder name indicating dates of data collection. Each of these folder further consists of subfolders with GM data for individual aggregate tracks. These subfolders contains the following: 

>> input_raw contains raw images from the GM acquisition. 

>> output_processed contains frames after basic contrast enhancement through ImageJ. 

>> registered_output contains frames after image registration step to remove high frequency background noise. This folder also contains the PIV analysis .mat file.

 >> track.csv contains the tracking data from the GM

Basic Shape-Velocity analysis:
The code shape_velo_automate gives the (size, structure, velocity) map of the data. The structure can be chosen to be the fractal dimension.

For PIV there are two parts to the code:
1) Image registration to remove high-frequency noise
2) PIV batch processing

These codes were used in a recent preprint: R. Chajwa et al. Hidden comet-tails of Marine snow Impede Ocean based Carbon Sequestration (2023) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.01982
