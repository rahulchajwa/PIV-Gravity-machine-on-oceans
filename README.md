# Particle Imaging Velocimetry in Noisy Environments
This is a set of codes for analysing the data from the Gravity machine [Krishnamurthy, D., Li, H., Benoit du Rey, F. et al. Scale-free vertical tracking microscopy. Nat Methods 17, 1040â€“1051 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-0924-7] on a ship. The high frequency noise is eliminated using a two-axis gimbal. For an example dataset see: Chajwa, Rahul et al. (2024). Hidden comet-tails of marine snow impede ocean-based carbon sequestration [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v15dv4253

There are two parts to the code:
1) Image registration to remove high-frequency noise
2) PIV batch processing

These codes were used in a recent preprint: R. Chajwa et al. Hidden comet-tails of Marine snow Impede Ocean based Carbon Sequestration (2023) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.01982
